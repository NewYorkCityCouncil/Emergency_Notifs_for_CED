## Interactive NYC Council Districts Map with Emergency Data

### Step 1

```{r}
# Step 1: Read the emergency data
emergency_data <- read_excel("~/Documents/Emergency_Notifs_for_CED/data/output/emergency_data_cleaned.xlsx")
# Filter Out ALL CMs category and make sure it's numeric
emergency_data <- emergency_data %>%
  filter(Council_District != "All Districts") 
```

### Step 2

```{r}
# Step 2: Download NYC Council Districts boundaries
# Using the confirmed working URL for NYC Council Districts GeoJSON
nyc_districts_url <- "https://services5.arcgis.com/GfwWNkhOj9bNBqoJ/arcgis/rest/services/NYC_City_Council_Districts/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson"
temp_geojson <- tempfile(fileext = ".geojson")
download.file(nyc_districts_url, temp_geojson, mode = "wb", quiet = TRUE)

# Read the GeoJSON file
nyc_districts <- st_read(temp_geojson)
```

### Step 3

```{r}
# Step 3: Process emergency data to get summaries by year, district, and incident type
# Add year column to emergency data
emergency_data <- emergency_data %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date_of_Incident))

# Filter for 2023 and 2024 data only
emergency_data <- emergency_data %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(2023, 2024))

# Calculate total incidents by district and year
district_year_summary <- emergency_data %>%
  group_by(Council_District, Year) %>%
  summarize(Total_Incidents = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(Council_District, Year)

# Get top 3 incident types by district
top_incidents_by_district <- emergency_data %>%
  group_by(Council_District, Incident) %>%
  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(Council_District) %>%
  arrange(Council_District, desc(Count)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  ungroup()

# Get council member names by district (taking the latest value)
council_members <- emergency_data %>%
  group_by(Council_District) %>%
  slice_tail(n = 1) %>%
  select(Council_District, Council_Member) %>%
  ungroup()
```

### Step 4

```{r}
# Step 4: Merge the data with the district boundaries
# Ensure all district IDs are characters for consistency
district_year_summary$Council_District <- as.character(district_year_summary$Council_District)
top_incidents_by_district$Council_District <- as.character(top_incidents_by_district$Council_District)
council_members$Council_District <- as.character(council_members$Council_District)

# Print data to verify structure and content
print("Council districts in emergency data:")
print(unique(district_year_summary$Council_District))

print("Council districts in boundaries data:")
print(unique(nyc_districts$CounDist))

# Create a wide format of district year summary (for easier joining)
district_year_wide <- district_year_summary %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Year,
    values_from = Total_Incidents,
    names_prefix = "Incidents_"
  )

# Get top incidents in a format easier to use in popups
top_incidents_formatted <- top_incidents_by_district %>%
  group_by(Council_District) %>%
  summarize(
    TopIncidents = paste(
      paste0(Incident, " (", Count, ")"),
      collapse = ", "
    ),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Add district data to the NYC districts spatial object
# Create a new spatial dataframe with all the information
nyc_map_data <- nyc_districts %>%
  mutate(district_id = as.character(CounDist)) %>%
  left_join(district_year_wide, by = c("district_id" = "Council_District")) %>%
  left_join(council_members, by = c("district_id" = "Council_District")) %>%
  left_join(top_incidents_formatted, by = c("district_id" = "Council_District"))

# Print to check if the join worked correctly
print("Number of districts with data:")
print(sum(!is.na(nyc_map_data$Incidents_2023) | !is.na(nyc_map_data$Incidents_2024)))

# Calculate total incidents for coloring (2023+2024)
nyc_map_data <- nyc_map_data %>%
  mutate(
    Incidents_2023 = ifelse(is.na(Incidents_2023), 0, Incidents_2023),
    Incidents_2024 = ifelse(is.na(Incidents_2024), 0, Incidents_2024),
    Total_Incidents = Incidents_2023 + Incidents_2024
  )
```

### Step 5
