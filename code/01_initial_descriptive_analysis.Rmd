## Upload Data

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
emergency_data <- read_excel("~/Documents/Emergency_Notifs_for_CED/data/input/04.07.25 Updated Emergency Services Team - Tracking Form.xlsx")
```

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

```{r}
# Drop Empty Column
emergency_data$`Form Field 1` <- NULL

# Standardize column names (replace spaces and hyphens with underscores)
names(emergency_data) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(emergency_data))
names(emergency_data) <- gsub("-", "_", names(emergency_data))
names(emergency_data) <- gsub("#_of", "Num_of", names(emergency_data))
names(emergency_data) <- gsub("___", "_", names(emergency_data))

# Print column names to verify
print("Column names after standardization:")
print(names(emergency_data)) # Looks good
```

## Extract Values

```{r}
